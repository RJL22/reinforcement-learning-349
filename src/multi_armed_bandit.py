        Trains the MultiArmedBandit on an OpenAI Gymnasium environment.

        See page 32 of Sutton and Barto's book Reinformcement Learning for
        pseudocode (http://incompleteideas.net/book/RLbook2020.pdf).
        Initialize your parameters as all zeros. For the step size, use
        1/N, where N is the number of times the current action has been
        performed. (This is the version of Bandits we saw in lecture before
        we introduced alpha). Use an epsilon-greedy approach to pick actions.

        See (https://gymnasium.farama.org/) for examples of how to use the OpenAI
        Gymnasium Environment interface.

        In every step of the fit() function, you should sample
            two random numbers using functions from `src.random`.
            1.  First, use either `src.random.rand()` or `src.random.uniform()`
                to decide whether to explore or exploit.
            2. Then, use `src.random.choice` or `src.random.randint` to decide
                which action to choose. Even when exploiting, you should make a
                call to `src.random` to break (possible) ties.

        Please don't use `np.random` functions; use the ones from `src.random`!
        Please do not use `env.action_space.sample()`!

        Hints:
          - Use env.action_space.n and env.observation_space.n to get the
            number of available actions and states, respectively.
          - Remember to reset your environment at the end of each episode. To
            do this, call env.reset() whenever the value of "terminated or truncated" returned
            from env.step() is True.
          - When choosing to exploit the best action rather than exploring,
            do not use np.argmax: it will deterministically break ties by
            choosing the lowest index of among the tied values. Instead,
            please *randomly choose* one of those tied-for-the-largest values.
          - MultiArmedBandit treats all environment states the same. However,
            in order to have the same API as agents that model state, you must
            explicitly return the state-action-values Q(s, a). To do so, just
            copy the action values learned by MultiArmedBandit S times, where
            S is the number of states.

        Arguments:
          env - (Env) An OpenAI Gymnasium environment with discrete actions and
            observations. See the OpenAI Gymnasium documentation for example use
            cases (https://gymnasium.farama.org/api/env/).
          steps - (int) The number of actions to perform within the environment
            during training.

        Returns:
          state_action_values - (np.array) The values assigned by the algorithm
            to each state-action pair as a 2D numpy array. The dimensionality
            of the numpy array should be S x A, where S is the number of
            states in the environment and A is the number of possible actions.
          rewards - (np.array) A 1D sequence of averaged rewards of length `num_bins`.
            Let s = int(np.ceil(steps / `num_bins`)), then rewards[0] should
            contain the average reward over the first s steps, rewards[1]
            should contain the average reward over the next s steps, etc.
            Please note that: The total number of steps will not always divide evenly by the 
            number of bins. This means the last group of steps may be smaller than the rest of 
            the groups. In this case, we can't divide by s to find the average reward per step 
            because we have less than s steps remaining for the last group.
